# Cafe Sanchez Case Study
 This repository contains the first version of the point-of-sale application that is the starting point for the Cafe Sanchez case study.  
 
 ## Introduction
 
 A point-of-sale (POS) system is a combination of hardware and software that allows businesses to process sales transactions, track inventory, and manage customer information. POS systems can include a variety of components, such as a cash register, barcode scanner, receipt printer, and credit card reader. Modern POS systems also often can connect to the internet, allowing for real-time inventory updates and data analysis. Additionally, many POS systems can integrate with other business software, such as accounting or customer relationship management systems. Overall, a POS system is a key tool for businesses to manage sales and inventory effectively.

### Scenario
Café Sanchez is a small coffee shop that is operated by the owner. This means taking the customers’ orders, processing them, and handing them out from the counter. To help the owner in the day-to-day work, a system that can keep track of customer orders and support the workflow in the café, is desired.  

A typical workflow is described by the owner like this:  

*When a customer comes into the shop, she places an order for one or more beverages. The order is written onto a piece of paper with the customer’s name and is processed. When it is ready, the customer’s name is called and she steps up to the counter, pays, and get the beverages.*  
 
Through meetings with the café owner, the following additional information about the desired system is documented:  
* The system must be able to keep track of several orders simultaneously but does not keep records of the sales. 
* When an order is finished and paid for, it is deleted from the system. 
* Also, there is no need for handling payments.
